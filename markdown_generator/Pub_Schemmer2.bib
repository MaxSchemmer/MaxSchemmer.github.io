  abstract = {Controlling the photon statistics of light is paramount for quantum science and technologies. Recently, we demonstrated that transmitting resonant laser light past an ensemble of two-level emitters can result in a stream of single photons or excess photon pairs. This transformation is due to quantum interference between the transmitted and incoherently scattered two-photon component. Here, using the dispersion of the atomic medium, we actively control the relative quantum phase between these two components. We thereby realize a tunable two-photon interferometer and observe interference fringes in the normalized photon coincidence rate, varying from antibunching to bunching. Beyond the fundamental insight that the quantum phase between incoherent and coherent light can be tuned and dictates photon statistics, our results lend themselves to the development of novel quantum light sources.},

From the measured squeezing spectrum we gain direct access to the phase and amplitude of the energy-time entangled part of the two-photon wave function which arises from the strongly correlated transport of photons through the ensemble. For small atomic ensembles we observe a spectrum close to the line shape of the atomic transition, while sidebands are observed for sufficiently large ensembles, in agreement with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we vary the detuning of the probe light with respect to the atomic resonance and infer the phase of the entangled two-photon wave function. From the amplitude and the phase of the spectrum, we reconstruct the real and imaginary part of the time-domain wave function. Our characterization of the entangled two-photon component constitutes a diagnostic tool for quantum optics devices.},

By performing nonlinear classical-field calculations for a homogeneous system, we show that the gas reaches a nonthermal state where different modes have acquired different temperatures. After losses have been turned off, this state is robust with respect to the nonlinear dynamics, described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We argue that the integrability of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is linked to the existence of such long-lived nonthermal states and illustrate this by showing that such states are not supported within a nonintegrable model of two coupled 1D gases of different masses. We go beyond a classical-field analysis, taking into account the quantum noise introduced by the discreteness of losses, and show that the nonthermal state is still produced and its nonthermal character is even enhanced. Finally, we extend the discussion to gases trapped in a harmonic potential and present experimental observations of a long-lived nonthermal state within a trapped 1D quasicondensate following an atom-loss process.},

  abstract = {Waveguide QED with cold atoms provides a potent platform for the study of non-equilibrium, many-body, and open-system quantum dynamics. Even with weak coupling and strong photon loss, the collective enhancement of light-atom interactions leads to strong correlations of photons arising in transmission, as shown in recent experiments. Here we apply an improved mean-field theory based on higher-order cumulant expansions to describe the experimentally relevant, but theoretically elusive, regime of weak coupling and strong driving of large ensembles. We determine the transmitted power, squeezing spectra and the degree of second-order coherence, and systematically check the convergence of the results by comparing expansions that truncate cumulants of few-particle correlations at increasing order. This reveals the important role of many-body and long-range correlations between atoms in steady state. Our approach allows to quantify the trade-off between anti-bunching and output power in previously inaccessible parameter regimes. Calculated squeezing spectra show good agreement with measured data, as we present here.},

  abstract = {The interaction of light with a single two-level emitter is the most fundamental process in quantum optics, and is key to many quantum applications. As a distinctive feature, two photons are never detected simultaneously in the light scattered by the emitter. This is commonly interpreted by saying that a single two-level quantum emitter can only absorb and emit single photons. However, it has been theoretically proposed that the photon anti-correlations can be thought to arise from quantum interference between two possible two-photon scattering amplitudes, which one refers to as coherent and incoherent. This picture is in stark contrast to the aforementioned one, in that it assumes that the atom even has two different mechanisms at its disposal to scatter two photons at the same time. Here, we validate the interference picture by experimentally verifying the 40-year-old conjecture that, by spectrally rejecting only the coherent component of the fluorescence light of a single two-level atom, the remaining light consists of photon pairs that have been simultaneously scattered by the atom. Our results offer fundamental insights into the quantum-mechanical interaction between light and matter and open up novel approaches for the generation of highly non-classical light fields.},

We describe the gas within the linearized Bogoliubov approach.

The dimensionless 1D interaction parameter {$\gamma$}, evaluated at the trap center, spans more than 2 orders of magnitudes over the different sets of data. We present a theoretical analysis for a homogeneous 1D gas in the quasicondensate regime, which predicts that the ratio kBT/(mc2) converges towards 0.6 under the effect of three-body losses.
