I am an experimental quantum physicist working with ultracold atoms. My research focuses on the use of cold atom platforms as clean model systems to study a wide range of many-body quantum phenomena.

I am currently working with ultracold molecules at CNR-INO/LENS in Florence (IT). Previously, I worked on quantum optics as a lecturer and Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow at the Humboldt University of Berlin (DE) combining nanofibers with cold atoms. I obtained my PhD in Paris-Saclay (FR) under the supervision of Isabelle Bouchoule, where I worked on the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of integrable quantum systems with an atomchip experiment.
